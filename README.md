# iOS Journey Roadmap

This repository contains every plus-size piece of iOS development material that I've gone through so far. It is comprised mostly of Ray Wenderlich (now [Kodeco](https://kodeco.com)) books and courses on core topics, as well as other recognizable authors.

## General

- [x] **[Swift Apprentice](swift-apprentice)** — best entry-level book that made me fall in love with Swift. Every concept is well-presented, supported by explainers and cemented by challenges.

- [x] **Swift in Depth** — old but gold piece exploring language features usually forgotten by Swift users, like pattern matching, optionals, dispatch and more.

- [x] **Advanced Swift** — a comprehensive encyclopedia on every aspect of Swift there is. Like The Swift Programming Language book, but with much more examples.

- [x] **[Combine: Asynchronous programming with Swift](combine)** — incredibly visual and complete take on Combine, a framework long forgotten...

- [x] **[Modern Concurrency in Swift](modern-concurrency)** — covers every topic of modern concurrency, but has many flaws architecture-wise. **Adapted for iOS 17 Observability by me.**

## UIKit

- [x] **[UIKit Apprentice](uikit-apprentice)** — great UIKit primer with a scope large enough to cover everything from IB to size classes.

- [x] **[Design Patterns by Tutorials](design-patterns-by-tutorials)** — quite overcomplicated guide to patterns in Swift, though much of complex code to unravel.

- [x] **[iOS Dev Interview Practice](ios-dev-interview-practice)** — decent guide around a take-home app, but overall it's just an architectural mess (especially with concurrency).

- [x] **objc: App Architecture** — good examples on MV+ family of patterns + Elm!

## SwiftUI

- [x] **[objc: Thinking in SwiftUI](thinking-in-swiftui)** — the title says it all, a brilliant piece revealing inner workings of a new declarative UI approach.

- [x] **[100 Days of Swift](100-days-of-swift)** — legendary video series covering a plethora of SwiftUI APIs and integrations.

- [x] **[Real-World iOS by Tutorials](real-world-ios-by-tutorials)** — **the most complex and comprehensive piece out of all presented here. Clean and MVVM app that is ready to deploy.**

- [x] **Advanced iOS App Architecture** — a noisy guide to production-grade MVVM and Redux over RxSwift, with a well written chapter on Dependency Injection.

## Future

- [ ] **Apple Augmented Reality by Tutorials** — a primer on RealityKit and ARKit getting ready for Vision.

- [ ] **Metal by Tutorials** — journey into Metal shaders that are now supported in SwiftUI and iOS 17.
